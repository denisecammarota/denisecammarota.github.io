Welcome to my personal website! My name is Denise (she/her). I am a PhD student in Physics in the Institute for Theoretical Physics of UNESP (IFT-UNESP), in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Previously, I did a BSc and MSc in Physics at Instituto Balseiro, in Argentina. I enjoy using maths, data science and data-driven tools to tackle complex problems. In my research, I analyse and visualize epidemiological data from infectious disease notifications, predict and understand epidemiological phenomena, and develop tools to improve epidemiological surveillance efforts, particularly in arboviral diseases, measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARI).
